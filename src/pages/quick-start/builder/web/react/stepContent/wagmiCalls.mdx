title: Making Blockchain Calls
---

Since Wagmi is configured in this application, you can directly use the wagmi hooks to make
blockchain calls. We have demonstrated some commonly used hooks like `useBalance`, `useAccount`,
`useSignMessage`, `useSendTransaction` and `useSwitchChain`.

You can refer to the [**wagmi docs**](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks) for more information on the
hooks.
