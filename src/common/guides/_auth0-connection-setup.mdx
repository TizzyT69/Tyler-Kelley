To use Auth0 with Web3Auth, you need to create a connection between the two services. Follow these
steps:

1. Visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).
2. Go to the `Custom Connections` section.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CustomConnectionOptions}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Custom Connection Options"
  />
</div>

3. Click on the `Settings` icon near the Auth0 connection.
4. Enter the `Auth Connection ID` - this will be used in your code as `authConnectionId`.
5. Select the `JWT user identifier`: `email`, `sub` or `custom`.
6. Toggle the Case Sensitivity of `User Identifier` if needed.
7. Enter `Auth0 Client ID` from the Auth0 application you created earlier.
8. Enter `Auth0 Domain` from your Auth0 dashboard.
9. Click on the `Add Connection` button to create the connection.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "left" }}>
  <img
    src={Auth0Connection}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Auth0 Connection"
  />
</div>

> You will require the `Auth Connection ID` you created for integrating Auth0 with Web3Auth in your
> application.
