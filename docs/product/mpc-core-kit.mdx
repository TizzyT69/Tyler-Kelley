The MPC Core Kit is designed for applications that need advanced security and complete control over
their authentication flows. It provides the necessary tools and flexibility to build sophisticated
authentication systems while maintaining high security standards.

## How MPC Core Kit Works

Using the Web3Auth MPC Core Kit, you can authenticate users and generate signatures for blockchain
transactions through distributed key shares, without ever reconstructing the private key. The SDK
uses a 2-of-3 threshold signature scheme where the key shares are distributed across:

- **Web3Auth Network Share:** Managed by Web3Auth Network and accessible through OAuth providers
  like Google, providing a familiar authentication experience.

- **Device Share:** Securely stored on the user's device, leveraging platform-specific security
  features like biometric authentication on mobile devices.

- **Recovery Share:** A backup share that can be stored on a secondary device, downloaded for
  offline storage, or derived from user input like passwords or security questions.

To sign transactions, users need access to any two of these three shares. The shares independently
create partial signatures which are then combined using TSS to create the final valid signature.
