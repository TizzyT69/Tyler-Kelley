## How Plug and Play Works

Below is a simplified overview of the Plug and Play authentication flow for you users:

1. Visit your dApp.
2. Initiate login (using the Web3Auth Modal/ Custom UI).
3. Authenticate via OAuth or social login.
4. Complete any required 2FA setup.
5. Log in to your dApp with an application-scoped key.
