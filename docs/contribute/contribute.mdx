#### Open source is the past, present, and future.

We invite you to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping people on our
community forum and our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/web3auth), helping to triage,
reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, adding to our documentation, adding new language
support, or helping out in any other way. Before you get started, we encourage you to be gracious,
respectful, and professional.

#### Helping out in a triage process

Triage is the process of going through GitHub issues and
[Community Forum posts](https://web3auth.io/community/), determining if they are valid, finding out
how to reproduce them, and catching duplicate reports.

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

#### Developing for Web3Auth

If you prefer to write code, you may wish to start with our list of issues on
[Web3Auth](https://github.com/Web3Auth), [torusresearch](https://github.com/torusresearch), and
[tkey](https://github.com/tkey) repositories. See the respective sections below for further
instructions.

#### Documentation

Another great area to contribute is Web3Auth samples and documentation. Our API docs reside in
[web3auth/docs](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-docs), and our samples reside in
[web3auth/web3auth-pnp-exampless](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples). In general, a
really productive way to improve documentation is to use Web3Auth and stop any time you have a
question: find the answer, then document the answer where you first looked for it.

#### Translation

If you are interested in participating in our translation process, which may involve supporting new
languages, and improving our existing translations, then head over to
[web3auth/web3auth-locales](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-locales) repository.
