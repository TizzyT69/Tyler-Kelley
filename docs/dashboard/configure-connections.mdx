To use Web3Auth for user onboarding, developers must first configure the login methods that their
application will support. All Web3Auth client SDKs require at least one login method to be enabled
for authentication to function. This configuration ensures that users can authenticate securely and
reliably across various platforms and environments.

:::note

A thoughtfully configured set of login options improves accessibility, enhances security, and
provides flexibility for future scalability.

## Social Connections

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={AuthenticationSocialConnections}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Authentication Social Connections"
  />
</div>

### Basic Logins

Basic Logins refer to standard authentication methods such as passwordless email or phone number
login. These options are particularly useful for users who may not wish to use social accounts or
external wallets.

For most applications, it is recommended to either pair Basic Logins with alternative methods (such
as social or external logins) or enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**. This ensures users
can retain access to their accounts even if they lose access to a primary login method. Supporting
multiple login types also improves reach across various regions where certain providers may be
limited.

### Social Logins

Social Logins allow users to authenticate using their existing accounts from widely adopted
platforms, offering a seamless and familiar experience. Web3Auth supports a wide range of social
identity providers, including:

Each social login method can be configured individually through the Web3Auth Dashboard. Developers
can follow platform-specific guides to obtain necessary credentials (e.g., client IDs, secrets) and
enable the desired providers.

## Custom Connections

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={AuthenticationCustomConnections}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Authentication Custom Connections"
  />
</div>

Custom Connections allow developers to integrate Web3Auth with third-party or self-hosted identity
providers. Supported platforms include:

<CustomConnections />

These integrations offer advanced flexibility, enabling projects to maintain existing identity
infrastructure while benefiting from Web3Auth’s non-custodial key management. Developers can
authenticate users using their preferred systems while still supporting seamless blockchain wallet
access.

:::note TIP

Custom connections are ideal for enterprises or apps with an existing authentication backend who
want to integrate Web3 capabilities without compromising on their current identity solutions.

## Group Connections

Group Connections enable multiple login methods to be linked to the same on-chain user identity.
This means that users logging in with different authentication providers (e.g., **_Google and Email
Passwordless_**) can still access the same wallet address—ensuring a unified user experience.

Before setting up a group connection, developers must first configure individual login connections
that are eligible to be grouped. Once eligible connections are established, they can be grouped
together under a single Group Connection.

<GroupConnections />

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={AuthenticationGroupConnectionsSelect}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Authentication Group Connections"
  />
</div>

:::note

Group Keys differ from standard individual connection keys. Ensure that each login method intended
for grouping is properly configured beforehand.

:::

> Group Connections are especially useful in scenarios where users may switch or alternate between
> login methods, allowing for continuous access to the same digital identity without fragmentation.
