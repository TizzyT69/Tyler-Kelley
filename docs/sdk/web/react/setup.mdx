For a seamless integration in React, Web3Auth provides essential React hooks for Web3Auth Modal SDK.
These hooks, paired with Wagmi or Solana Hooks (our custom implementation), become a powerful
combination for building your dApp quickly and efficiently.

## Web3Auth Provider

In your main entry file (generally `index.tsx` or `main.tsx`), import the `Web3AuthProvider`
component and wrap your application with it.

```tsx title="main.tsx"
import "./index.css";

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
// focus-next-line
import { Web3AuthProvider } from "@web3auth/modal/react";
import web3AuthContextConfig from "./web3authContext";

import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  {/* focus-start */}
  <Web3AuthProvider config={web3AuthContextConfig}>
    <App />
  </Web3AuthProvider>,
  {/* focus-end */}
);
```

### Config

The Web3Auth Provider requires a `config` object to be passed in. This config object contains the
config you setup in the [Configuration Section](./config).

```tsx title="web3authContext.tsx"
// focus-next-line
import { type Web3AuthContextConfig } from "@web3auth/modal/react";
import { WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, type Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET, // or WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_DEVNET
};

// focus-start
const web3AuthContextConfig: Web3AuthContextConfig = {
  web3AuthOptions,
};
// focus-end
```

## Blockchain Setup

Web3Auth is built to be blockchain agnostic, enabling integration with any blockchain network. For a
comprehensive guide, see the [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain) section. Out of the box,
Web3Auth offers robust, first-class support for both **Solana** and **Ethereum**, each with
dedicated React hooks to streamline your development process.

### Solana Integration

Solana hooks are included natively within the `@web3auth/modal` package. No additional setup is
requiredâ€”simply use the provided hooks to interact with Solana networks.

For detailed usage and examples, visit the [**Solana Hooks**](./solana-hooks) section.

### Ethereum Integration

Ethereum hooks are provided through the popular `wagmi` library, which works seamlessly with
Web3Auth. This allows you to leverage a wide range of Ethereum hooks for account management,
transactions, and more.

section.
