Web3Auth provides a set of React hooks for basic Solana wallet operations. These hooks are designed
to simplify common Solana interactions in your React app.

:::info

For advanced Solana features, you should use
[`@solana/web3.js`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) on top of the hooks provided.

## Solana Hooks

| Hook Name                   | Description                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `useSignAndSendTransaction` | Sign and send a Solana transaction.          |
| `useSignMessage`            | Sign a message with the Solana wallet.       |
| `useSignTransaction`        | Sign a Solana transaction (without sending). |
| `useSolanaWallet`           | Access Solana wallet state and utilities.    |

Further code and advanced usage should be implemented using Solana's web3.js library as needed.
