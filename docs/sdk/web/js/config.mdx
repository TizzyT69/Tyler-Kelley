import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import Web3AuthOptions from "@site/src/common/sdk/pnp/web/_web3auth-options.mdx";

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to configure. For this, you need to create an
instance of the config object `Web3AuthOptions`, and pass it in the constructor.

:::info Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have registered on the
[Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and have set up your project. You can look into
the [Dashboard Setup](/dashboard-setup) guide to learn more.

## Instantiating Web3Auth

This Web3Auth constructor takes an object with `Web3AuthOptions` as the type.

:::note Type Reference

Import the type `Web3AuthOptions` for easy type interface for Typescript.

```javascript
import { type Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";
```
