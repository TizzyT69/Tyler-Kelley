Web3Auth Plug and Play (PnP) provides a comprehensive authentication solution for Web3 applications,
handling everything from social logins to external wallet connections, giving you a simplified
interface to connect to the user's preferred wallet. It serves as a unified connection experience
for all wallet types, simplifying user onboarding and authentication management.

## Web3Auth SDK [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/)

The Web3Auth SDK provides two main integration approaches:

### Modal Approach

- **Complete UI Package**: Includes a ready-to-use modal interface with all authentication options
- **Customizable Appearance**: Extensive whitelabeling options to match your application's branding
- **Simple Integration**: Minimal code required to implement full authentication capabilities

### No Modal Approach

The same SDK can be used without the pre-built UI components:

- **Complete UI Control**: Build your own authentication interface from scratch
- **Invisible Integration**: Can be implemented in a way that's completely transparent to users
- **Core Functionality**: Includes all authentication adapters and wallet connection methods
- **Flexible Implementation**: Can be integrated at any level of your application architecture

- This is a frontend SDK and can only run in a browser environment
