:::warning SDK Errors & Warnings

Check out our guide for common **[SDK Errors & Warnings](/troubleshooting/sdk-errors-warnings)**

### Bundler Issues: Missing Dependencies

You might encounter errors related to missing dependencies in the browser environment when
implementing Web3Auth.

Common error messages include `Buffer is not defined`, `process is not defined`, or other
Node.js-specific modules that aren't available in browsers by default.

These Node.js dependencies need to be polyfilled in your application to enable Web3Auth
functionality properly. Additionally, your bundler configuration may need adjustments to handle
these dependencies correctly during the build process.

We've prepared detailed troubleshooting guides for popular bundlers:

### Different Private Keys across integrations

If you are getting different private keys across integrations, it is likely because you are using
different conflicting projects, SDKs, or configurations. Please refer to our troubleshooting guide
**[Different Private Keys across integrations](/troubleshooting/different-private-key)** to
understand and resolve this issue.
