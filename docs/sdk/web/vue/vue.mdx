Web3Auth Plug and Play (PnP) offers a seamless authentication experience for Vue applications,
making it easy to integrate social logins, external wallets, and more—all through a unified,
Vue-friendly interface. With our Vue Composables, you can quickly connect users to their preferred
wallets and manage authentication state with minimal code.

## Vue Composables Integration with Web3Auth

### `@web3auth/modal/vue`

The Web3Auth Vue SDK provides a set of powerful composables that let you:

- Effortlessly connect users using the built-in modal for a ready-to-use authentication UI.
- Build fully custom login experiences by bypassing the modal and connecting directly to specific
  authentication methods.
- Manage authentication state (connected, loading, error) in a way that feels natural in Vue.

**Integration Options:**

- **Modal (Default & Easiest):** Use the modal for a complete, customizable authentication
  interface. Just use a composable and display a button—Web3Auth handles the rest.
- **Custom UI (No Modal):** Use composables to connect directly to specific login methods, giving
  you full control over the user experience and UI.

Whether you want a plug-and-play modal or a fully custom authentication flow, `@web3auth/modal/vue`
makes it simple to add secure, Web3-ready authentication to your Vue app.
