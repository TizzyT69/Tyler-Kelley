Web3Auth Plug and Play (PnP) provides a comprehensive authentication solution for Web3 applications,
handling everything from social logins to external wallet connections, giving you a simplified
interface to connect to the user's preferred wallet. It serves as a unified connection experience
for all wallet types, simplifying user onboarding and authentication management.

Web3Auth offers two primary SDK options for web applications, each designed for different
implementation needs:

## 1. Modal SDK [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/)

The Modal SDK provides a pre-built, customizable UI component that handles the entire authentication
flow:

- **Complete UI Package**: Includes a ready-to-use modal interface with all authentication options
- **Customizable Appearance**: Extensive whitelabeling options to match your application's branding
- **Simple Integration**: Minimal code required to implement full authentication capabilities
- **All-in-One Solution**: Includes all core functionality from the No Modal SDK

Head to the [`@web3auth/modal` SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/modal) section to get started.

## 2. No Modal SDK [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal)

The No Modal SDK provides the core authentication functionality without any predefined UI
components:

- **Complete UI Control**: Build your own authentication interface from scratch
- **Invisible Integration**: Can be implemented in a way that's completely transparent to users
- **Core Functionality**: Includes all authentication adapters and wallet connection methods
- **Lightweight**: Smaller package size compared to the Modal SDK
- **Flexible Implementation**: Can be integrated at any level of your application architecture

This SDK is ideal for developers who need complete control over the user experience or want to
deeply integrate Web3Auth into their existing authentication flows.
