The `@web3auth/modal` package provides a complete authentication solution with a pre-built,
customizable UI component that handles the entire Web3 authentication flow. This package:

- Includes a ready-to-use modal interface with all authentication options
- Offers extensive whitelabeling capabilities to match your application's branding
- Requires minimal code to implement full authentication functionality
- Bundles all core Web3Auth features in one convenient package

:::tip

Since it inherits from the [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) package, you can access all
the underlying functionality while benefiting from the pre-built UI components.

If you prefer complete control over the UI or need an invisible authentication experience, consider
using the [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) SDK instead.
