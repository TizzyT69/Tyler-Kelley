The Web3Auth [Unreal Engine SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unreal-sdk) is a client-side
library that allows you to authenticate users using Web3Auth on `Unreal` game engine. This SDK has
been written mainly in `C++` and can be integrated preferably across all mobile platforms. It
returns a private key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This
authentication can be achieved by using any social login options that Web3Auth supports or using a
custom authentication flow of your choice.

### Requirements

- Unreal Engine `v5.3.1` with Xcode 15
- [Epic Game Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) to download Unreal library.
