The Web3Auth [Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-android-sdk) is a client-side
library you can use with your Android app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. For using Web3Auth
natively in Android, Web3Auth provides an Android SDK written in _Kotlin_. It returns a private key
generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This authentication can be
achieved by using any social login options that Web3Auth supports or custom authentication flow of
your choice.
