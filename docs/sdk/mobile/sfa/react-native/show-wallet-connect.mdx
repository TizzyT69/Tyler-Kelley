---

For enabling interoperability with Wallet Connect, ie. connecting your W3A generated wallet to other
dApps which have Wallet Connect integration, you can use the `showWalletConnectScanner()` method.
This method uses the Wallet Connect `copy and paste` flow, in which you can directly copy the QR
Code details from a dApp like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and paste in the modal.

:::note

This is a paid feature and the minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this
SDK in a production environment is the **Scale Plan**. You can use this feature in Web3Auth Sapphire
Devnet network for free.
