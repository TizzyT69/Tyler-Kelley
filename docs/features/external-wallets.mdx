Web3Auth SDK allows you to connect using external wallets. You can configure this using two
different ways.

## Wallet Discovery

Users can connect to their existing wallets (EVM and Solana) using wallet discovery. This feature
leverages Multi Injected Provider Discovery
([MIPD - EIP6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963)), Solana's
[Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/blob/master/extensions/solana.md)
& Wallet Connect, to enable users to connect to any wallet of their choice.

## Integrating Web3Auth within Wagmi

In addition to Web3Auth’s native adapters, developers can integrate Web3Auth with wallet aggregation
libraries like wagmi. This integration enables the use of Web3Auth within popular frameworks and
products, enhancing Web3Auth’s flexibility and reach.

Using the `@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector`, developers can incorporate Web3Auth into WAGMI’s
React Hooks for Ethereum. This connector supports the Plug and Play Web SDKs of Web3Auth, enabling
integration with products like RainbowKit, ConnectKit, and Web3Modal.

:::tip

You can follow this guide to integrate [Web3Auth Wagmi Connector](/sdk/pnp/web/wagmi-connector)
within your dApp.

For highly customised integrations, you can follow the source code of the
[`@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector) to
create your own Wagmi Connector.
