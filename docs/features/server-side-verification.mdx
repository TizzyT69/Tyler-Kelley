Web3Auth's server-side verification feature enables developers to securely authenticate users on the
backend by validating the ownership of a wallet address. This process involves the use of a JSON Web
Token (JWT) issued upon user authentication, which contains claims about the end user, including
proof of ownership over a wallet public address.

Upon a user's successful connection of their wallet, Web3Auth generates a JWT, signed with a private
key using the ES256 algorithm, that is unique to your application. This token serves as a verifiable
credential that you can use to authenticate the user on your backend.

#### Implementing Server-Side Verification

To implement server-side verification with Web3Auth:

1. **Retrieve the JWT (`idToken`):** When a user logs in through Web3Auth, a JWT (JSON Web Token)
   can be generated to prove that the user owns the wallet, and you can verify it on your backend
   server.

   **Different Flows for Different Wallets:**

   - **Social Logins**: These tokens include a public key linked to the user's wallet.
   - **External Wallets**: These tokens include the wallet address instead of the public key.

2. **Verify the JWT:** Use the public key/address provided by Web3Auth to verify the JWT's
   authenticity. This step confirms that the token is valid and the information it contains about
   the user can be trusted.
3. **Authenticate the User:** Based on the verified claims within the JWT, including wallet address
   ownership, authenticate the user in your backend system.
