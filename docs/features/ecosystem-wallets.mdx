Web3Auth Ecosystem Wallets take our embedded wallet SDKs to the next level. You can now enable a
single user identity across multiple apps, providing one wallet for your entire ecosystem.

### What Ecosystem Wallets Offer

- **Unified Login Experience**: Provide users with a single login across all your applications.
  Users retain the same wallet across your ecosystem, unlike the app scoped wallets.
- **Ready to launch UI and Branding**: Deploy a fully white-labeled, production-ready UI that can be
  hosted on your domain, reducing developer effort and speeding up your go-to-market.
- **Developer Ownership**: Take full control of the developer experience by offering a white-labeled
  SDK that developers integrate directly as your npm package
- **In-App Transaction Approvals**: Allow users to sign transactions and manage approvals directly
  within your app, eliminating the need to switch to external wallets or extensions.
- **Gasless**: Upgrade to a smart contract wallet spun from an EOA, combining the benefits of MPC
  (Multi-Party Computation) and smart wallets for a frictionless user experience.
