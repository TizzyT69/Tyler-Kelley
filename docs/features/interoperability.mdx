Web3Auth Wallet Services' interoperability feature is designed to provide users and developers with
a fluid, cohesive blockchain experience. We offer interoperability via

- **Ecosystem Wallets:** Build your own wallet ecosystem that dApps can seamlessly integrate with.
  Users on any of dApps that integrate your wallet ecosystem will have a unified account. This
  allows users to access and utilize their assets and NFTs across multiple dApps within your
  ecosystem. To learn more, see [here](./ecosystem-wallets).

- **WalletConnect Support:** Web3Auth enhances interoperability by integrating with WalletConnect.
  This integration enables users of Web3Auth to connect their wallets to a vast array of dApps such
  as NFT marketplaces, DeFi, etc.
