Create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a few lines of code, using Web3Auth's
native smart accounts. With smart accounts, you can offer enhanced control and programmability, such
as these listed below:

- **Gas Sponsorship:** Cover transaction fees, or allow users to pay for their own transactions
  using ERC-20 tokens.

- **Batch Transactions:** Perform multiple transactions in a single call.

- **Automated Transactions:** Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH
  hits $4,000.

- **Set Spending Limits:** Allow users to set tailored spending limits.

and how it works.

## Getting Started

Our native smart accounts powered by Account Abstraction (AA) simplifies setup, enabling you to
create and manage smart accounts effortlessly with popular libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Web3.js
—no need for third-party packages to achieve ERC-4337 compatibility. We are working closely with
different partners in the account abstraction ecosystem and will provide support for evolving
standards like EIP-7702, ERC-7579 (Modular Accounts), and ERC-7555 (account discovery) as they get
finalized.

Getting started is easy; you just have to select your preferred smart account provider, configure
your bundler client, and integrate your paymaster. [See this link for the steps.](/sdk/web/react)
