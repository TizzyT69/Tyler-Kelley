Web3Auth's whitelabeling capabilities allow customization of the user interface, branding, and
translations, ensuring the authentication flow seamlessly aligns with your application's identity.

With Single Factor Auth & MPC Core Kit SDKs, Web3Auth is invisible to the user, and you have the
complete control over the user interface, branding, and translations.
