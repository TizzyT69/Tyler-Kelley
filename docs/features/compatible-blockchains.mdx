Web3Auth works easily with many different blockchains. Whether you're using Ethereum, Solana, or
another chain, Web3Auth fits in smoothly, making it simple to add secure authentication to any
platform.

:::tip Reference

Check out our [**Connect Blockchain Reference**](/connect-blockchain) for more details on how to
connect different blockchains with Web3Auth.

Chains and Networks are now
[configurable on the Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/create-new-project/#chains-and-networks).

## Guides

Explore our comprehensive guides for integrating Web3Auth with various blockchain networks. We
provide detailed documentation for both EVM and non-EVM chains across multiple Web3Auth providers.

:::info Can't Find Your Chain?

Web3Auth officially supports the secp256k1 and ed25519 key curves. However, with Plug and Play SDKs,
you can convert the key curves into your specific requirements.

Please follow our guide on how to
[**connect to any Non EVM Blockchain**](/connect-blockchain/other/) with Web3Auth.
