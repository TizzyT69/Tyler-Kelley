Custom Authentication enables you to create tailored auth flows designed specifically for your app.
Whether you’re migrating from an existing system or starting fresh, we’ve got you covered.

## Authentication Methods

### 1. Web3Auth's Built-in Social Logins

Web3Auth provides pre-built social login solutions that work out of the box. These use Web3Auth's
internal credentials and require minimal setup:

- Ready-to-use implementation
- Quick integration
- Managed by Web3Auth
- Limited customization options
- Best for rapid prototyping and simple applications

### 2. Custom Authentication (Recommended)

Custom Authentication offers more flexibility by allowing you to:

- Use your own credentials for social logins
- Integrate your existing authentication system
- Connect third-party identity providers (Auth0, Cognito, etc.)
- Maintain full control over the authentication flow
- Create custom user experiences
- Handle complex authentication requirements

### 3. Grouped Custom Authentication

This method combines multiple authentication providers under a single
[group connection](/authentication/group-connections), enabling:

- Same private key generation across different login methods
- User account linking across multiple providers
- Unified authentication experience
- Single user identity with multiple login options
- Seamless transition between authentication methods
