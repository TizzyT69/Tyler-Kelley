This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v4 to v5 of the SFA Flutter SDK. The
guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of Web3Auth's Sapphire
network support.

## Breaking Changes

### Changes in `SFAParams` constructor parameters

In v5, we try to improve the developer experience by renaming the parameter, and introducing a new
parameter for session management.

- `clientid` parameter, used to define Web3Auth's Client ID, has been renamed to `clientId` to align
  with naming conventions.
- `sessionTime` was added to specify session duration in seconds. By default, the value is set to
  86400 seconds (1 day), with a maximum session duration of up to 30 days

```dart
final singleFactAuthFlutter = SingleFactAuthFlutter();

await singleFactAuthFlutter.init(
    // focus-start
    SFAParams(
        network: Web3AuthNetwork.mainnet,
        // remove-next-line
        clientid: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
        // add-start
        clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
        // Defines the session time of 40 seconds
        sessionTime: 40,
        // add-end
    ),
    // focus-end
);
```

### TorusKey is renamed to SFAKey

In v5, the `TorusKey` is now removed. Developers can now use `SFAKey` to access the private key and
address for the account. It was renamed to maintain consistency across SDKs.

### Deprecation of authentication methods

#### `getKey` method

In v5, the `getKey` method is removed. Developers can now use `connect`, the common method for
single verifier and aggregate verifier login. This change was done to improve the developer
experience and align with other Web3Auth SFA Mobile SDKs.

```dart
// remove-next-line
final TorusKey key = await singleFactAuthFlutter.getKey(
// add-next-line
final SFAKey key = await singleFactAuthFlutter.connect(
    LoginParams(
        verifier: 'YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME',
        verifierId: "VERIFIER_ID",
        idToken: "ID_TOKEN",
    ),
);
```

#### `getAggregateKey` method

In v5, the `getAggregateKey` method is removed. Developers can now use `connect`, the common method
for single verifier and aggregate verifier login. This change was done to improve the developer
experience and align with other Web3Auth SFA Mobile SDKs.

```dart
// remove-next-line
final TorusKey key = await singleFactAuthFlutter.getAggregateKey(
// add-next-line
final SFAKey key = await singleFactAuthFlutter.connect(
    LoginParams(
        verifier: 'YOUR_SUB_VERIFIER_NAME',
        verifierId: "VERIFIER_ID",
        idToken: "ID_TOKEN",
        aggregateVerifier: "AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME"
    ),
);
```

## New Addition: Sapphire Support

We are happy to announce that with v5, SFA Flutter SDK now supports the Web3Auth Sapphire networks.
Developers can now use the verifiers deployed on sapphire networks. Please check the supported
networks by the SDK.

```dart
enum Web3AuthNetwork {
  mainnet,
  testnet,
  cyan,
  aqua,
  celeste,
  sapphire_devnet,
  sapphire_mainnet
}
```
