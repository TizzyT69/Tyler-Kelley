Web3Auth offers robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance the security and recoverability
of user accounts. MFA acts as an additional layer of protection, requiring users to authenticate
using two or more verification methods before gaining access to their accounts. This system is
designed to ensure key ownership remains self-custodial while maintaining ease of access and
recovery.

To activate MFA, users must configure at least one backup factor. Upon setup, Web3Auth splits the
user’s private key into three shares using an off-chain threshold signature scheme. This
cryptographic approach guarantees that even if one share is lost or compromised, access to the
wallet can still be securely recovered using the remaining factors.

Users can choose from various authentication methods including device-based shares, social logins,
backup seed phrases, password factors, passkeys, and authenticator apps. These options offer
flexibility for both account security and cross-device accessibility.

## MFA Levels

The `mfaLevel` parameter allows developers to configure the behavior and frequency of MFA prompts
within their applications. This setting determines how and when users are prompted to configure or
verify their backup factors.

Supported values for `mfaLevel` include:

- `default`: Displays the MFA setup screen every third login. Ideal for balanced security and user
  convenience.
- `optional`: Shows the MFA screen on every login, but users can skip the setup if desired.
- `mandatory`: Forces MFA setup immediately after login. This is recommended for applications
  prioritizing strong user authentication.
- `none`: Completely bypasses the MFA setup screen. Suitable for use cases where MFA is managed
  externally or intentionally disabled.

## MFA Settings

The `mfaSettings` parameter provides granular control over which backup factors are available to
users and the order in which they appear in the UI. This enables developers to tailor the MFA
experience to match their application’s security requirements and user preferences.

Available MFA factors:

- `deviceShareFactor`: Device-specific key share that is stored securely on the user’s device.
- `backUpShareFactor`: Recovery factor using a backup seed phrase.
- `socialBackupFactor`: Backup authentication using a linked social account (e.g., Google, Apple,
  etc.).
- `passwordFactor`: User-defined password used as a recovery mechanism.
- `passkeysFactor`: Passkey-based authentication (FIDO/WebAuthn standard) for biometric or
  hardware-based login.
- `authenticatorFactor`: TOTP-based one-time codes generated through apps like Google Authenticator
  or Authy.

## Benefits of MFA

- **Self-Custodial Security**: Key shares remain under user control without reliance on a
  centralized entity.
- **Cross-Device Recovery**: Users can regain access to their accounts even if they switch devices.
- **Flexible Implementation**: Developers can choose the right balance between security and UX by
  tuning MFA behavior and available factors.
- **Threshold Signature Architecture**: Enhances resilience against loss or compromise of individual
  factors.

By integrating Web3Auth’s MFA, developers can provide a secure, user-friendly authentication system
that aligns with the decentralized principles of web3 while delivering modern account recovery and
protection features.
