**Web3Auth** offers a robust authentication system designed to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3
identity, providing developers with powerful tools to implement secure, flexible, and user-friendly
onboarding flows. By offering fine-grained control over login experiences and wallet integrations,
Web3Auth helps enhance user conversion while enabling seamless access to blockchain-based
functionality.

Using Web3Auth’s client-side SDKs, applications can authenticate users through a variety of
mechanisms, supporting both traditional (Web2) and decentralized (Web3) identity paradigms.

## Supported Authentication Methods

Web3Auth supports a wide range of authentication options, enabling developers to meet the needs of
diverse user bases and platform requirements.

### Email or SMS Login

Provides passwordless login via one-time passcodes (OTP) sent to the user’s
[email address](/authentication/basic-logins/email-passwordless) or
[phone number](/authentication/basic-logins/sms-otp). This method is widely accessible and
especially useful for onboarding users unfamiliar with Web3 or crypto wallets.

### External Wallets

Users can also authenticate using
[third-party wallets](/authentication/basic-logins/external-wallets) such as MetaMask,
WalletConnect, Phantom, and others. Developers can select which wallets to display via the Web3Auth
Dashboard, providing tailored options based on user preference or regional relevance.

### OAuth and Social Login

Web3Auth supports a variety of social identity providers, allowing users to authenticate using
accounts they already trust and use daily. Supported providers include:

- [Google](/authentication/social-logins/google)
- [Apple](/authentication/social-logins/oauth#apple)
- [Twitter (X)](/authentication/social-logins/oauth#twitter)
- [Facebook](/authentication/social-logins/facebook)
- [Discord](/authentication/social-logins/discord)
- [Twitch](/authentication/social-logins/twitch)
- [GitHub](/authentication/social-logins/oauth#github)
- [Farcaster](/authentication/social-logins/oauth#farcaster)
- and [more](/authentication/social-logins/oauth).

Social login simplifies onboarding by reducing friction and improving usability—particularly in
consumer-facing applications.

### JWT-Based Authentication

Web3Auth allows integration with any existing JWT-based authentication system. This includes OpenID
Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 compliant identity providers such as:

- [Auth0](/authentication/custom-connections/auth0)
- [Firebase Authentication](/authentication/custom-connections/firebase)
- [AWS Cognito](/authentication/custom-connections/aws-cognito)
- [Custom JWT providers](/authentication/custom-connections/custom-jwt)

This is ideal for applications that already have a secure identity layer and want to enhance it with
non-custodial wallet generation and key management.
