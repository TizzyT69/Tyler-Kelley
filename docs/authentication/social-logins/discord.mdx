Discord Login is a social login provider that allows users to sign in using their Discord
credentials. Web3Auth supports Discord as a social login provider, allowing developers to offer a
familiar and quick authentication method for users with Discord accounts.

To integrate Discord with Web3Auth, developers must first create a Discord App via the
[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Create a Discord app

<DiscordSetup />

## Create a Discord Connection

:::success Enable on Dashboard

To use this feature, please enable `Discord` from the Social Connections section in the
[Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

> By default, Web3Auth uses its own pre-configured credentials for Discord login.

:::

<div style={{ display: "flex", margin: "20px 0", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={DiscordToggle}
    style={{
      maxWidth: "800px",
      borderRadius: "8px",
      boxShadow: "0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)",
    }}
    alt="Toggle Discord Connection on Dashboard"
  />
</div>

Follow these steps to create a Discord connection:

1. Visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).
1. Go to the `Social Connections` section.
1. Click on the `Settings` icon near the Discord connection.
1. Enter the `Auth Connection ID`.
1. Enter the `Discord Client ID`.
1. Finally, click on the `Add Connection` button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", margin: "20px 0", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={DiscordConnection}
    style={{
      maxWidth: "600px",
      borderRadius: "8px",
      boxShadow: "0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)",
    }}
    alt="Discord Connection"
  />
</div>

## Usage

Since, the `Discord Connection` details are available from Dashboard, developers don't need to pass
any additional parameters to the `Web3AuthProvider`.

> Follow our [Quickstart Guide](/quick-start) to setup the basic flow.

### Login with Discord

```jsx
await connectTo(WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH, {
