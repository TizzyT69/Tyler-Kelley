Auth0 allows you to easily add authentication to your application. Web3Auth supports Auth0 as a
service provider. You can create a connection for Auth0 and integrate it into your application. This
page will help you set up Auth0 as a service provider with Web3Auth.

## Create an Auth0 Application

If you haven't already, create an Auth0 application for your project. It is the mandatory step
before we proceed further. After the basic setup, we'll learn how to create an Auth0 connection for
the Web3Auth project. You can follow the link below to set up Auth0 for your project. If we are
missing any platform/framework, you can always
[check out Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native#webapp).
