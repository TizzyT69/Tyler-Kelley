You can incorporate your login providers by utilizing one of the custom login schemes, including RSA
or ECDSA signatures. By doing so, your users can continue using your current login providers or your
custom authentication scheme.

For signing the JWT, your application must follow the JWT specification and use the private key
corresponding to the JWKS. And the public keys of the JWT should be exposed through an endpoint,
which is used by Web3Auth to verify the JWT.

### Generate JWT

To generate the JWT, you can choose package of your choice. We have documented few of the well known
packages.

- [Generate JWT using jsonwebtoken](/docs/authentication/custom-connections/custom/jsonwebtoken)
- [Generate JWT using jose](/docs/authentication/custom-connections/custom/jose)

### Login with JWT

{/* TODO: Add Login with JWT Steps */}

## What are JWKS?

JWKS stands for JSON Web Key Set. It is a set of keys containing the public keys that should be used
to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the RS256
signing algorithm.

### How to create JWKS?

- Most of the login providers that support JWT-based login will provide you this URL, such as
  Firebase, Google, Auth0, AWS Cognito etc.

  - Firebase: `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/{your-project-id}`
  - Auth0: `https://{your-domain}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  - Google: `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`
  - AWS Cognito: `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json`

- If you are using your own custom JWT, you will need to convert your PEM file to JWKS.

### How to convert PEM to JWKS?

If you're using `jose` or `jsonwebtoken` library, you can use the following steps to convert your
PEM file to JWKS.

1. Create a Private Key using openssl.

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out privateKey.pem 2048
   ```

   This privateKey will be used to sign the token.

2. Using the above privateKey.pem file, create a Public Key.

   ```bash
   openssl rsa -in privateKey.pem -pubout -out publicKey.pem
   ```

   This publicKey.pem file will be converted to JWKS.

3. Convert the publicKey.pem file to JWKS.

   Now, look for a tool that converts `.pem` to `jwk(s)` format.

   - One of the tools is https://pem2jwk.vercel.app/
     - Select Signing Algorithm: `RS256`
     - Select Public Key Use: `Signing`
     - Key ID: `paste-yours` or leave it blank to generate a random one.
     - PEM encoded key: `{paste-the-publicKey-pem-file-s-content-here}`
   - Click on the `Convert to JWK` button.

4. To complete the process, you need to save the output as a `.json` file, host it on your server,
   and make sure it's publicly accessible.

   This will give you the `JWKS Endpoint`, which is required when setting up a `Custom JWT Verifier`
   on the Web3Auth Dashboard.
