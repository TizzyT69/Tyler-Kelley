Firebase allows you to easily add authentication to your application. Web3Auth supports Firebase as
a service provider. You can create a connection for Firebase and integrate it into your application.
This page will help you set up Firebase as a service provider with Web3Auth.

## Create a Firebase Project

If you haven't already, create a Firebase project. It is the mandatory step before we proceed
further. After the basic setup, we'll learn how to create a Firebase connection for the Web3Auth
project. You can follow the link below to set up Firebase for your project. For React native, you
can set up Firebase for Android and iOS separately. If we are missing any platform/framework, you
can always [check out Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/libraries).

export const FirebaseSetup = [
  {
    name: "",
    description: "",
    tiles: [
      {
        key: "web",
        title: "Web",
        icon: "logo-js.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "android",
        title: "Android (Kotlin)",
        icon: "logo-android.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "ios",
        title: "iOS",
        icon: "logo-apple.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "flutter",
        title: "Flutter",
        icon: "logo-flutter.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "unity",
        title: "Unity",
        icon: "logo-unity.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup",
      },
    ],
  },
];
