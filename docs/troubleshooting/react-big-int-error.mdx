While developing your React app with `@web3auth/modal`, there might be a case where the application
is working fine in development mode but when you build the app for production, you get the following
error:

> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number

This error is caused by the fact that the production build of React is not specified the versions of
the browsers. Due to this the production build of React uses the default browserlist configuration
which might lead to the above error. This can be solved by adding the following lines to the
`package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
"browserslist": {
    "production": [
      "supports bigint",
      "not dead",
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
```

By adding these lines, you are telling the Javascript bundlers to use specific versions of the
browsers for the production build. After adding the above lines, create the production build again
and you should be good to go.
