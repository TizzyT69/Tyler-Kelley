Web3Auth offers SDKs for various libraries across multiple platforms and devices. Thanks to our
vibrant community of developers and their various implementations, we have collated some top-asked
questions as guides to help you quickly understand and figure out some edge cases in the
implementations.

If you're still facing errors, you can always ask for help via the following channels:

- Look at our [Web3Auth Community](https://web3auth.io/community/) to see if anyone has any
  questions or issues you might be having.
- Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/web3auth) to join our community and get private integration
  support or help with your integration.
