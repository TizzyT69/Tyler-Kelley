## Overview

While using the Web3Auth Web SDK, you get an EIP1193-compatible provider, similar to the MetaMask
provider. This provider can be used with libraries like TronWeb to make blockchain calls such as
getting the user's account, fetching balances, signing transactions, sending transactions, etc. We
have highlighted a few examples to get you started quickly.

---

## Installation

To interact with the Tron blockchain, you can use the Web3Auth provider and TronWeb.

### NPM Installation

```bash
npm install @web3auth/no-modal @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/auth-adapter @web3auth/wallet-services-plugin tronweb
```

## Getting the Web3Auth Provider

After initializing Web3Auth, the next step is to authenticate and retrieve the provider to interact
with the Tron blockchain.

```typescript
await web3auth.connect();

// Get the provider
const provider = web3auth.provider;
```

Once logged in, Web3Auth provides a JWT token and access to the Tron provider.

---

## Fetching User Info

After logging in, you can retrieve information about the user.

```typescript
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log(user);
```

---

## Get Account and Balance

Once logged in, we can use `tronRpc.ts` to fetch the user's account and balance.

```typescript
// tronRpc.ts should be implemented as per previous example
const tronRpc = new TronRpc(provider);
await tronRpc.init();

// Get the user's Tron account address
const accounts = await tronRpc.getAccounts();
console.log("Account: ", accounts[0]);

// Get the balance
const balance = await tronRpc.getBalance();
console.log("Balance: ", balance);
```

---

## Send Transaction

You can send a transaction using the user's private key.

```typescript
const transaction = await tronRpc.sendTransaction();
console.log("Transaction Hash: ", transaction);
```

This will send a transaction from the user's Tron account.

---

## Sign a Message

You can also sign a message using the private key of the logged-in user.

```typescript
const signedMessage = await tronRpc.signMessage("Hello Tron!");
console.log("Signed Message: ", signedMessage);
```

This will return the signature of the message.

## Conclusion

With Web3Auth, you can easily integrate Tron blockchain capabilities into your application. By using
the TronWeb library, you can perform various blockchain operations such as fetching accounts,
sending transactions, signing messages, and interacting with smart contracts.
